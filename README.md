### homebrew commands
```bash
brew doctor                  # Check for any brew issues

## Cluster Setup

1. Go to digitalocean and create an account
2. Go to your control panel and click `Kuberbnetes`

3. Create your cluster and download your config file when it is ready (it will take some times to be ready). This allows kubectl to connect to your cluster.

4. Get kubectl
   ```bash
     brew install kubectl
   ```
5. Type this command in the terminal before running kubernetes
    ```bash
      export KUBECONFIG=/Users/your-name/Downloads/[your_config_file]
    ```

    *  To find config file in terminal, type this
        ```bash
          ls -lorth
        ```
6. To confirm connection
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
7. Install NGINX ingress controller
   ```
   helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
     --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace \
     --set controller.ingressClassResource.name=nginx \
     --set controller.ingressClass=nginx
   ```

## Usage

1. Check nodes in your cluster 
   ```bash
    kubectl get nodes  # show cluster nodes -> the name should match with your node pools in k8s cluster
   ```
2. Modify the your domain in the `manifest.yaml` particularly in the ingress section
   ```yaml
         spec:
           tls:
             - hosts:
                 - www.chaewon.ca          # your domain name
               secretName: wordpress-tls   # cert will be stored here
           rules:
             - host: www.chaewon.ca       # your domain name
   ```
3. Apply manifest.yaml to your kubernetes cluster
      ```bash
        kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
      ```
4. Get your ip address
      ```bash
         kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx      # check 'EXTERNAL-IP' to find your ip address
      ```
5. Point your DNS to your IP address: after getting the svc public ip address, apply it to the domain that you are working with  
    This is an example in Digital Ocean.
   
   | Type  | Hostname    | Value    | TTL     |
   |-------|-------------|----------|---------|
   |  A    | www         | your-ip-address  | Defalut |

        
6. Setup HTTPS with cert-manager
   ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
    kubectl apply -f manifest-step2.yaml
   ```
7. Check TLS is working
   ```bash
   kubectl describe certificate wordpress-tls
   ```
    if it works fine, you will see
   ```bash
   Message: Certificate is up to date and has not expired
   Status: True
   ```
8. Go to your domain, and you will be able to see the Wordpress there
